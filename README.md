# CBL-Digital-Twins
This repo contains the code for a proof-of-concept robot we built for gallbladder surgery, that was paired with a digital twin in PyBullet to allow for the operator to get warnings in real time, for example in scenarios where they got too close to areas like the bile duct, which they should not be cutting.

## Setup Description
To install dependencies, run in your terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
